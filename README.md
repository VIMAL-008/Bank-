**Bank Transaction Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Project Report.**
**Summary of Tools:**
 **  Programming Languages and Libraries.**
Python: Python is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and EDA because of its powerful libraries and easy-to-read syntax.
**Key Libraries**:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (e.g., handling data frames, cleaning data).
NumPy: For numerical computing, often used in conjunction with Pandas for data processing.
Matplotlib: A basic plotting library for creating static visualizations like line graphs, histograms, bar plots, etc.
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is used for more advanced statistical plots and making plots easier to read.
Plotly: For interactive visualizations and web-based dashboards.
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebook.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly,, Power BI.
Version Control: GitHub
Raw daaset: Kaggle.
The objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank transaction dataset. The goal is to understand the patterns, trends, and insights that can be derived from the data. This report will cover the steps taken during the analysis, including data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of results.
