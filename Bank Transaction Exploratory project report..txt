Bank Transaction Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Project ReporT

Summary of Tools:
   Programming Languages and Libraries.
Python: Python is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and EDA because of its powerful libraries and easy-to-read syntax.

Key Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (e.g., handling data frames, cleaning data).
NumPy: For numerical computing, often used in conjunction with Pandas for data processing.
Matplotlib: A basic plotting library for creating static visualizations like line graphs, histograms, bar plots, etc.
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is used for more advanced statistical plots and making plots easier to read.
Plotly: For interactive visualizations and web-based dashboards.
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebook.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI.
Version Control: GitHub
Raw daaset: Kaggle.


1. Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank transaction dataset. The goal is to understand the patterns, trends, and insights that can be derived from the data. This report will cover the steps taken during the analysis, including data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of results.

2. Dataset Description
For this analysis, we will assume a dataset containing transactional information from a bank. The dataset might include the following features:

Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
Account Number: The account number involved in the transaction.
Transaction Date: Date and time of the transaction.
Transaction Type: Type of transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal).
Amount: The amount of money transacted.
Merchant: Merchant or company where the transaction took place (for debit/credit card transactions).
Balance: Account balance after the transaction.
Transaction Status: Successful or failed transaction.
3. Data Loading and Cleaning
The first step in any data analysis project is to load the data and clean it. Common tasks during this phase include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring that the data is in the correct format.

Code Example:

python
Copy
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('bank_transactions.csv')

# Check for missing values and handle them
df.isnull().sum()

# Drop rows with missing critical values
df.dropna(subset=['Transaction ID', 'Account Number', 'Amount'], inplace=True)

# Convert columns to appropriate data types
df['Transaction Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Transaction Date'])

# Remove duplicate transactions
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Check the first few rows of the dataset
df.head()
4. Data Exploration
4.1 General Statistics Understanding the basic statistics of the dataset (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) is essential to gain a sense of the data distribution

# Visualize the trend of transactions over time
monthly_transactions.plot(kind='line', title='Transactions Over Time')
6.2 Balance Trends for Accounts Examine how account balances fluctuate over time to understand customer financial activity.

9. Conclusion and Insights
From the analysis, we can derive several insights:

Transaction Patterns: We can observe if there are peak transaction periods during specific times of the day or month.
Customer Behavior: By analyzing the average transaction amounts and account balance trends, we can identify high-value customers and their spending habits.
Outliers and Fraud: Anomalies in transaction amounts could be indicative of fraudulent behavior, especially for certain transaction types or account activity.
Transaction Type Distribution: The balance between deposit and withdrawal transactions can reveal key insights into customer activity.
